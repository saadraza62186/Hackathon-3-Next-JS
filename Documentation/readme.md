Restaurant Management System Documentation

Overview --->>>>

This project is a Restaurant Management System developed during a hackathon. The project is divided into three phases: defining business goals, planning the technical foundation, and implementing API integration with data migration.

Project Phases
Day 01: Business Focus

On Day 1, we emphasized the importance of focusing on business requirements before
jumping into technical implementation. Here’s what we achieved:

1. Business Goals Defined:
o You identified the problem your marketplace aims to solve.
o You defined your target audience and the unique value proposition (UVP) of
your marketplace.
2. Data Schema Drafted:
o Using paper and pencil, you created a preliminary data schema outlining
entities like products, orders, customers, and their relationships.
3. Single Focus:
o By concentrating on business requirements without technical distractions,
you set a solid foundation for the technical phase.
These achievements are critical as they ensure your marketplace aligns with real-world
business needs. 

Day 2 Activities: Transitioning to Technical Planning

1. Define Technical Requirements
The first step is to translate our business goals into clear technical requirements. For
each feature identified on Day 1, outline the following:

 Frontend Requirements:
o User-friendly interface for browsing products.
o Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
o Essential pages: Home, Product Listing, Product Details, Cart, Checkout,
and Order Confirmation.
 Sanity CMS as Backend:
o Use Sanity CMS to manage product data, customer details, and order
records. Sanity acts as the database for your marketplace.
o Focus on designing schemas in Sanity to align with the business goals
from Day 1.
 Third-Party APIs:
o Integrate APIs for shipment tracking, payment gateways, and other
required backend services.
o Ensure APIs provide the necessary data for frontend functionality. 

2. Design System Architecture
Create a high-level diagram showing how your system components interact. Use tools
like pen and paper or software like Lucidchart, Figma or Excalidraw. For example, a
more detailed architecture might include workflows such as:
[Frontend (Next.js)]
 |
[Sanity CMS] ---------> [Product Data API]
 |
[Third-Party API] -----> [Shipment Tracking API]
 |
[Payment Gateway]

In this architecture, a typical data flow could look like this:

1. A user visits the marketplace frontend to browse products.
2. The frontend makes a request to the Product Data API (powered by Sanity CMS)
to fetch product listings and details, which are displayed dynamically on the site. 
3. When the user places an order, the order details are sent to Sanity CMS via an
API request, where the order is recorded.
4. Shipment tracking information is fetched through a Third-Party API and
displayed to the user in real-time.
5. Payment details are securely processed through the Payment Gateway, and a
confirmation is sent back to the user and recorded in Sanity CMS. 

Example System Architecture:
[Frontend (Next.js)]
 | | |
[Sanity CMS] [3rd Party APIs]

Key Workflows to Include:
1. User Registration:
o User signs up -> Data is stored in Sanity -> Confirmation sent to the user.
2. Product Browsing:
o User views product categories -> Sanity API fetches data -> Products
displayed on frontend.
3. Order Placement:
o User adds items to the cart -> Proceeds to checkout -> Order details
saved in Sanity.
4. Shipment Tracking:
o Order status updates fetched via 3rd-party API -> Displayed to the user. 
3. Plan API Requirements

Based on your data schema, define the API endpoints needed. Include:
 Q-Commerce Example:
o Endpoint Name: /express-delivery-status
o Method: GET 
o Description: Fetch real-time delivery updates for perishable items.
o Response Example: { "orderId": 123, "status": "In Transit", "ETA": "15 mins" }
